# Prime Numbers

This is a repo where I'll be testing different prime number algorithms.


## Story of Inspiration
Inspiration. I was in this random class where we were learning about prime numbers, more specifically Euclid's theory of prime numbers.

So I thought two things

1. Is there any interesting pattern between the consecutive difference between prime numbers?
2. And then, assuming we go to infinity, what is the longest difference between consecutive prime numbers?

Consecutive prime numbers? 

List of the first five prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11

Difference between the first two prime numbers: 3 - 2 = 1

Difference between the second and third prime numbers: 5 - 3 = 2

In this first example, the longest difference would be 4 (11-7).

# That is what I want to figure out. 


First, I got interested in this because I wanted to see if there was an interesting pattern from the consecutive difference between prime numbers.

- Could you find a pattern between the consecutive difference?
	- What's the longest difference?
